"""
Bot F Signal — Copytrade (Market Slug Mirroring)
Follows "smart money" markets where historical resolution accuracy
indicates the crowd consistently prices the correct outcome.
If a market slug has resolved > ACCURACY_THRESHOLD correctly in the
past, we mirror the current market bias (buy whichever side is > 0.55).
